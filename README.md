This is an assignment that I did for a company "Tawasol Riyadh" for the role of Unity Developer.

Here are the project details that the assignment asked me to build:
# Build a 3D game with any assets you like, in which there can be only 2 players in a room.
# Each player can walk normally and jump with the key 'E' as the spacebar is used to shoot a 3D object in the direction where the player is currently looking.
# Environment should be kept simple as here we are only testing for the development process and file management and handling.

Things I added by myself:
# Some UI elements to make the game understandable and playable.
# The UI includes, connecting to server, join room / create room, then wait for the other player to join as only 2 members are allowed in each room.
